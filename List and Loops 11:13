#Now that we know how to append values to a list, we can take the steps below to compute the average app rating:

#We initialize an empty list.
#We start looping over our data set and extract the ratings.
#We append the ratings to the empty list we created at step one.
#Once we have all the ratings, we:
#use the sum() command to sum up all the ratings (to be able to use sum(), we'll need to store the ratings as floats or integers); and then
#we divide the sum by the number of ratings (which we can get using the len() command).
